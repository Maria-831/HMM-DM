{"name":"Hmm-dm","tagline":"","body":"HMM-DM\r\n======\r\nThe HMM-DM program identifies differentially methylated (DM) CG sites and regions from whole genome and targeted bisulfite sequencing (BS) data. This approach first uses a Hidden Markov Model to identify differentially methylated CG sites accounting for spatial correlation across CGs and variation across samples, and then summarizes identified DM CG sites into regions based on their status and distance. This program takes aligned BS data in multiple samples and outputs identified DM CG sites and regions.\r\n\r\nHMM-DM requires a Linux/Unix system, with R installed. The program includes one document and two folders:\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n \r\nHMM.DM.user.manual.pdf:\tA copy of the user manual\r\n \r\nHMM.DM.code: A folder containing all R source code files used for HMM-DM.\r\n \r\nexample.data: A folder containing all example input data, an example.script.txt for running HMM-DM, and the output files generated from the example.script.txt.\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
